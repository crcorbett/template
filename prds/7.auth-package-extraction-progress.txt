## Iteration 1
- Completed: Create @packages/auth package structure with Effect dependencies
- Changes:
  - packages/auth/package.json: deps effect, better-auth, @packages/types, @packages/database
  - packages/auth/tsconfig.json: extends base config
  - packages/auth/src/index.ts: re-exports auth types from @packages/types
  - packages/auth/vitest.config.ts: standard vitest config for Effect testing
  - bun.lock: updated with new workspace package
- Updated: prd.json item 1 (category: architectural) → passes: true
- Notes: Package structure follows existing patterns in packages/core, packages/database. No @effect/schema added separately as Schema is included in effect 3.x.
